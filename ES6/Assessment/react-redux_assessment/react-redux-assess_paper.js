//Assessment #4

//1. Create a class component and show all the life cycle hooks

// See LifeCycleComp.js

//2. Make a state change, the state should be duplicate and then stop it to call render method to improve efficiency.

//3. Create a product component using functional component and hooks (try using useState to read default values from reducer)

// 	 Create a form to allow user to submit Product Details - name, price, desc, rating
// 	 Create an action method to add the detail to database using a server api
// 	 Server Side - Create product router and api to save the product using productdatamodel

//4. Create a route and navigation to show product component

// See app.js and HeaderComp.js

//5. Explain various hooks in functional component (at least 5)

// useState - hook that allows the developer to create and update state (triggers re-render)
// useEffect - hook that can trigger a block of code when re-render occurs
// useDispatch - used in the same way as a dispatcher to the store, works like mapDispatchToProps
// useRef - creates a reference variable that can be used like state but is not tightly linked to react render
// useSelector - hook that allows you to access the store's state
